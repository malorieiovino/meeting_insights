# Meeting Insights

A Python toolkit and demo app for automatically processing meeting transcripts to:

1. **Extract concise, extractive summaries** of key discussion points  
2. **Identify and categorize action items** with assigned owners, priorities, and deadlines  
3. **Segment conversations by topic** for easier navigation and per-topic summaries  

This repo contains both the core processing library (`meeting_insights.py`) and a simple demo UI (e.g. Streamlit/Gradio) that you can deploy on GitHub Pages, Heroku, or Hugging Face Spaces.

- **Data loading & preprocessing**: Compatible with the [AMI meeting corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/edinburghcstr/ami) (IHM transcripts), but can be extended to any turn-by-turn transcript.  
- **Topic segmentation**: Sliding-window TF-IDF cosine drops with minimum-segment-size smoothing.  
- **Extractive summarization**: TF-IDF / position / speaker novelty-based scoring.  
- **Action-item extraction**: Regex + lightweight POS filters â†’ owner resolution â†’ priority/deadline estimation â†’ confidence scoring.  
- **Interactive demo**: View topic word-clouds, summaries, action-items tables.
